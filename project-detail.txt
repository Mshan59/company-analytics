Absolutely 💰 — **adding a Budget feature** that’s **visible only to the company owner (or admin)** is a **great idea** and fits perfectly with your startup-focused project management system.

Let’s structure this feature properly 👇

## 🧩 **System Structure (Updated with Budget Management)**

### 🧠 **User Roles**

| Role                | Access Level | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Owner / Admin**   | Full         | Can view/manage everything — including budgets, invoices, and team billing.                  |
| **Project Manager** | Medium       | Can create projects, assign tasks, and view team progress — but no access to company budget. |
| **Team Member**     | Limited      | Can view assigned tasks, mark progress, and comment — no financial or team-wide view.        |

## 🔒 **Budget Privacy Logic**

You can implement a **role-based access system** like this:

```ts
if (user.role === 'owner') {
  showBudgetSection();
} else {
  hideBudgetSection();
}
```

Or using backend (FastAPI/Node.js):

```python
@app.get("/budget")
def get_budget(user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):
    if user.role != "owner":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied")
    return fetch_budget_data()
```

## ✅ **Benefits of Adding Budget Module**

* Adds **professional credibility** to your app.
* Makes your app more useful for **small startups** that track limited spending.
* Gives owners **financial control visibility** while keeping the team focused on delivery.

Would you like me to show a **dashboard layout wireframe (visual structure)** for how these modules fit together — including the **owner view** with a **budget section** and a **simpler member view**?
That’ll help you design or build it easily next.
